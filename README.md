Inspiration

Based on my observations of friends and information on school social platforms during my undergraduate campus life, the issue of lost personal items was common in the university. Traditional methods such as posting notices or registering at lost and found centers often suffered from delays and inefficiency. With the advancement of digitalisation in universities, designing a WeChat mini-program for lost and found would enhance the efficiency of locating lost items and reduce unnecessary losses. Additionally, such a system would promote the spirit of honesty and integrity, fostering a more harmonious campus environment.

Description

The campus lost and found project includes two parts: the WeChat mini-program and the backend management system. The WeChat mini-program (user side) is divided into eight main modules: user registration and login, information posting, search and display, comments, item categorisation, details and bookmarking and personal center.

Regular administrators can manage users, categories, and item information in the backend management system (admin side), while super administrators have all the permissions of regular administrators and can also manage the information of regular administrators.
